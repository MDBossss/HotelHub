# HotelHub
This project was made with focus on the frontend and polishing my knowledge on frontend design and technologies. The plan is to keep expanding the project with time so most likely not finished.
Technologies:
* React + Vite
* SASS
* TypeScript

Backend is currently a basic demonstration of using the REST api connected with Supabase, mostly for learning purposes. Lots of room for upgrades and improvement. 
Technologies:
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Supabase ( database, auth )

## Setting up environmental variables

To run the project you will need to create .env files inside both server and client directory and edit the variables as specified.


### server
```
SUPABASE_KEY = your_supabase_key
PORT = your_port_number
```

### client

```
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = your_google_maps_api_key
VITE_API_BASE_URL = http://localhost:3000
```
